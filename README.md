- 👋 Hi, I’m @rick4747
- 👀 I’m interested in computers and phones, basically smart devices and the capabilities as well the capability extentions and manipulations that are known.  I would like to extend some of those and get a little more educated because I am a newbie. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to unlock iPhone and ios devices from the frp and activation locks as well as any other security feature provided by Apple or developers. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on wiping your wife's vagina after she gets a train ran on her by a bunch of guys from the Geek Squad. 
- 📫 How to reach me: pppp4444pppp44@gmail.com or if you're smart enough you will figure it out yourself.
